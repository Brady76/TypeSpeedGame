	- To run on eclipse, start a new Java project, and Configure the Build Path. 
	  (Right-Click the Project to find Build Path, then config.)
	- Add a Library and make a new User Library, name it whatever you like. (Slick2D is a good name)
	- Then add external jars files from the zips into the User Library, this can be done with the external jars button.
	- Here are the four jars files required for this project: slick.jar, lwjgl.jar, jinput.jar, lwjgl_util.jar
	- After added the jars, expand the lwjgl.jar tab, and double-click the native library location.
	- Travel to where you extracted the slick.zip or lwjgl.zip and map the folder to that native lib location.
