Installation:
- To run on eclipse, start a new Java project, and Configure the Build Path. (Right-Click the Project to find Build Path, then config.)
- Add a Library and make a new User Library, name it whatever you like (Slick2D is a good name)
- Then add external Jars into the User Library, this can be done with the external jars button.
- Here are the four jars required for this project: slick.jar, lwjgl.jar, jinput.jar, lwjgl_util.jar
- After added the jars, expand the lwjgl.jar tab, and double-click the native library location.
- Travel to where you extracted the slick.zip or lwjgl.zip and map the folder to that native lib location.
